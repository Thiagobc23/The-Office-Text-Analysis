# THE OFFICE TEXT ANALYSIS

## Objective  
  
This project’s main purpose is to analyze a TV show in a reliable and measurable way, without the need to watch the whole show or rely on a personal perspective. The selected subject for this analysis is the sitcom ‘The Office’, which was selected mainly for the high availability of data.

## Data Collection 
The data collection process used two scripts __The_Office_Scraper.py__ and __IMDB_Scraper.py__, data collected by them is necessary for running the next notebooks.   
  
This same process can also be achieved with __1.The_Office_Scraper.ipynb__, where you can see what the scripts are doing with supporting documentation in a Jupyter notebook.

## Data Cleaning
  
Data Cleaning processes are outlined at __2.The_Office_Cleanning.ipynb__, and requires the previously collected data, this notebook will prepare the data and save all the variables required by the analysis process to a .csv file.
  
## Analysis
  
The analysis processes are outlined at __3.Analysis.ipynb__, and requires the previously collected, cleaned and prepared data.
